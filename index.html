			<h1><a name="about-me">About Me</a></h1>
			 <h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p> I am a self-proclaimed nerd who likes to play video games, go out socializing, and try new things. I received my Bachelors degree in accounting, but have been drawn towards development work in the last couple of years. I currently work for an online
				university, and am starting to get more into the IT side of things.</p>
				<p>I believe that learning and advancing your skills of what you love is important. I am excited to advance my programming and front end development knowledge. Knowledge is power!</p>
			 <h3>Where I'm from</h3>
				<p>Growing up with a dad in the military, I moved all over the U.S., and continued to do so even as an adult. I feel the need to jump states every few years once things become stagnant in my current location. I am currently living in Portland, Oregon.
				I love the hustle and bustle of the big city.</p>
			 <h3>More about me<h3>
			    <h4>What are your favorite hobbies?</h4>
				    <p> I love having a good time with good people, and experiencing new things.  I enjoy playing video games, especially the old school Nintendo games.  I believe variety and spontaneity are the spices of life.</p>
			    <h4>What's your dream job?</h4>
				    <p>I don't have a particular dream job in mind, but I know I want to be coding for a living.  Ever since I was first introduced to SQL a couple years ago, I have been hooked on programming languages and want to learn as much as I can.  I like to problem solve and fix bugs, and there is plenty of that in the programming world.</p>
